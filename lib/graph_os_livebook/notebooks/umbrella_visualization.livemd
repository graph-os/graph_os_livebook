# GraphOS Umbrella Application Visualization

## Introduction

This notebook provides interactive visualizations of the GraphOS umbrella application structure and dependencies.

## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:graph_os_livebook, "~> 0.1.0"},
  {:kino, "~> 0.11.3"},
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.8"},
  {:kino_vega_lite, "~> 0.1.10"}
])

alias GraphOS.Livebook.Visualizers.{Umbrella, Dependencies}
```

## Umbrella Structure Visualization

The following visualization shows the overall structure of the GraphOS umbrella application:

```elixir
Umbrella.visualize()
|> Kino.VegaLite.new()
```

## Dependency Visualization

This visualization shows the dependencies between different GraphOS components:

```elixir
Dependencies.visualize()
|> Kino.VegaLite.new()
```

## Component Details

Let's examine each component of the GraphOS umbrella application:

### GraphOS.Graph

The core graph library providing data structures, algorithms, and storage.

### GraphOS.Core

OS functions such as access control and security.

### GraphOS.MCP

Model Context Protocol implementation for AI/LLM integration.

### GraphOS.Livebook

Livebook integration for interactive graph analysis and visualization.

## Conclusion

GraphOS is designed as a modular, distributed graph operating system. Each component can be used independently or together within the umbrella application.
